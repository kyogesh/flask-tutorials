"""
Run simple flask server and different ways to run server

`flask run` will take default app.py.
`python app_two.py` will run flask server from app_two.py using `app.run()`.
Setting env var `FLASK_APP=app_three.py` will take app_three.py as default app file.
Shortcut to runnin flask server without setting FLASK_APP in env is `FLASK_APP=<app_file_name> flask run`.
